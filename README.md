## Global dependencies
Project dependencies are installed and managed via [npm](https://npmjs.org/), the Node.js package manager. Make sure your [npm](https://npmjs.org/) is up-to-date by running `npm update -g npm` (this might require `sudo` on certain systems).

**Fractal** is a tool to help you build, document and integrate component/pattern libraries into your web projects. Read more on [GitHub](https://github.com/frctl/fractal). Fractal makes use of a number of ES6 features that mean it currently requires Node.js v4.0+ to run.
